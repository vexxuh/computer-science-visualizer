# computer-science-visualizer
Purpose of the project is just to mess a round with different computer science concepts and mess around with the MonoGame Framework a bit. I just want to build my own visualizer tools and see them working real time. in a visual way. Just cool to see. I see this stuff on tiktok all the time and wanted to mess around with it and take it further.
