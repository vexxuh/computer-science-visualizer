# computer-science-visualizer
Purpose of the project is just to mess around with different computer science concepts and play with the MonoGame Framework a bit. I just want to build my own visualizer tools and see them working real time. Just cool to see. I see this stuff on TikTok all the time and wanted to mess around with it and take it further.
